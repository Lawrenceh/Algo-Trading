40. Market Making and Mean Reversion
=============================================
<Abstract>
We study the profitability of market making strategies in a variety of time series models for the evolution of a stock's price and analyze market making algorithms. Next, we identify a natural class of time series called mean-reverting processes whose properties make our market making algorithm profitable in expectation.

<Methodology>
- First provide a precise theoretical characterizatio of the profitability of a simple and natural market making algorithm in the absence of any stochastic assumptions on price evolution.
- Proved that market making is generally profitable on mean reverting time series.
