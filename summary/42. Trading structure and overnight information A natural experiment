42. Trading structure and overnight information: A natural experiment
=============================================
<Abstract>
We study the effect of trading mechanisms on stock return volatility using the TASE data set. (TASE represents a natural experiment which allows seperation of the overnight information effect from the trading mechanism effect.) 

<Methodology>
- Mostly done with: multivariate variance ratio tests

<Conclusion>
- The null hypothesis that opening variances equal closing variances cannot be rejected for either period.
- The tests cannot reject null that the ratio of opening to closing return variances is equal to across periods.
- This suggests that the trading mechanisms on the TASE do not differ in their effect upon return volatility.
