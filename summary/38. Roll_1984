38. A Simple Implicit Measure of the Effective Bid-Ask Spread in an Efficient Market
=============================================
<Abstract>
Given the market efficiency, the effective bid-ask spread can be measured by:
    SPREAD = 2 * SQRT(-cov)
where cov is the first order serial covariance of price changes. (This implicit measure is shown empirically to be closely related to firm size.)

<Methodology>
Probability analysis + transition matrix + autocorrelation

<Conclusion>
- Implicit estimate formula.
- The resulting estimates were strongly negatively related to firm size, thus supporting the measure of being related to trading costs (which are negatively related also to firm size).
- A sizeable difference was detected between spreads estimated from daily and weekly data. This implies informational inefficiency, or else very short-term nonstationarity in expected returns.
