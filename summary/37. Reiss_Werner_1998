37. Does Risk Sharing Motivate Interdealer Trading?
=============================================
<Abstract>
Despite the prevalence of interdealer trade, few academics have studied it. This paper uses LSE data to study the extent, causes and consequences of interdealer trade. More specifically, to test the hypothesis that dealers primarily use interdealer trades to reduce their inventory exposure.

<Methodology>
- Document the extent of interdealer trading and the degree to which it is associated with inventory imbalances resulting from customer and broker trades.
- Test whether dealers earn greater trading reveneues in return for assuming greater inventory risk.
- Examine whether interdealer trades themselves affect the trading revenues dealers receive when assuming inventory risk.
- (All the analysis based on the introduction of the INVENTORY CYCLE)

<Conclusion>
- Interdealer trade is prevalent and facilitates risk sharing among London dealers.
- The pattern of interdealer trade is consistent with theoretical predictions from models of inventory risk sharing. (More than 80% of interdealer trades during inventory cycles caused by large customer trades are in the direction predicted by risk sharing.)
- Interdealer trades typically take place between the dealers with the most extreme inventory imbalances.
- Dealers are compensated for the risk associated with the large inventory positions they assume.
