41. The Trading Profits of High Frequency Traders
=============================================
<Abstract>
We examine the profitability of HFT.

<Methodology>
- Analyze on transaction level data with user identifications.
- HFT profits by Counterparty.
- Spectral Analysis.
- Report a Profit-based Herfindahl index as well as a Volume-based one for entry/exit of firms.
- OLS regression to test persistence. (Profit ~ profit_last_time_point, aggressiveness, volume, volatility)
- OLS regressio on exit probability and the relationship between speed and profits.

<Conclusion>
- HFTs collectively earn over $23 million in trading profits in the E-mini S&P 500 futures contract during the month of August 2010.
- The profits of HFTs are mainly derived from Opportunistic traders, and also from Fundamental (institutional) traders, Small (retail) traders and Non-HFT Market Makers.
- Despite the risk, HFTs generate usually higher average Sharpe Ratios with a median of 4.5 across firms in August, 2010.
- HFTs profits are persistent, that is, new entrants have a higher propensity to underperform and exit, and the fastest firms (in absolute and in relative terms) earn the highest profits.
